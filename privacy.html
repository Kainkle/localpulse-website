        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="small" style="margin:0 0 14px;">
          <strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 28, 2025<br />
          <strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 28, 2025
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          LocalPulse ("we," "our," or "us") provides missed call text-back services to local businesses.
          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when operating our services.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Phone Numbers:</strong> We collect phone numbers from individuals who place calls to our clients' business phone lines. This information is collected automatically when a call is made.</p>
        <p><strong>Call Data:</strong> We collect basic call information including date, time, duration, and whether the call was answered or missed.</p>
        <p><strong>Client Business Information:</strong> We collect business names, phone numbers, and message templates from the businesses that use our service.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">How We Use Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Automated Text Messaging:</strong> When a call to one of our client businesses goes unanswered, we send an automated text message to the caller on behalf of that business. The text message acknowledges the missed call and provides information about how to reconnect with the business.</p>
        <p><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> Phone numbers and call data are used solely to facilitate communication between callers and the businesses they attempted to reach.</p>
        <p><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> We maintain logs of missed calls and text messages sent for reporting purposes to our client businesses.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Information Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>No Third-Party Sales:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or share phone numbers or call data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Client Access:</strong> Phone numbers and call data are shared only with the specific business that the caller attempted to reach.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Call data and phone numbers are retained for up to 90 days for service delivery and reporting purposes,
          then automatically deleted unless longer retention is required by law.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Your Rights</h2>
        <p><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may opt out of receiving text messages at any time by replying STOP to any message you receive from us. Your phone number will be immediately removed from our system.</p>
        <p><strong>Access and Deletion:</strong> You may request access to or deletion of your phone number from our records by contacting us at the email address below.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Message Consent</h2>
        <p>
          By calling a business that uses LocalPulse services, you consent to receive a one-time automated text message
          in response to your missed call. This is a transactional message, not marketing. Standard message and data rates may apply.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect.
          However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13.
          We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The effective date at the top of this page indicates when
          the policy was last revised. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>
